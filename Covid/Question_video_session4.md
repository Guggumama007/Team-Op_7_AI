Question 1:
-----------

**What, in your opinion, are the main ethical challenges related to the
use of AI in a company?**

Several questions can be and will be asked in the future regarding AI,
we will need to know what is behind the algorithm and being able to
understand and explain this process behind. Knowing if the AI will
replace people or will be a tool to improve the quality of the work. See
if AI will replace all types of worker or transform the way of working.
Find a way to operate digital transformation and apply an AI system
without creating a huge unemployment rate. Be sure that human will
always be involved in the AI process and play the role of the “safety
button”.

Question 2:
-----------

**What are the most important principles for defining « responsible AI »
?**

Avoid Biases, develop an ethical framework with several principles :
Responsibility and liability (including): 1. democratic participation 2.
well-being 3. autonomy 4. knowledge 5. privacy & intimacy 6. justice 7.
equity 8. diversity 9. prudence 10. sustainability

Question 3:
-----------

**What kind of biases can you face when we use « hiring algorithms » in
an HR context ? in an insurance context ?**

The data used to build the algorithm can create a bias, this would lead
to wrong advice for recruitment, to avoid bias, we should train the
algorithm without data regarding the sex, the race, the age, handicap or
others possible data that could lead to bias. the best way would be to
anonymize the data before training and testing the algorithm.

Question 4:
-----------

**How can the biases associated with the use of algorithms be reduced?**

1.  Use BI to visualize data and reduce or eliminate Bias.

2.  Develop new AI algorithms to detect Bias and fraud (e.g. Deep Fake).

3.  Produce a new Framework to increase transparency and cooperation.
